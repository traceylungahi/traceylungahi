# Hello There 👋🏾, I'm Tracey 

I am a full stack developer that enjoys building various web applications. I mostly enjoy backend development. Everyday is a day to learn something new, and therefore, I am still learning.

- I am currently available for hire and open to new job opportunities or collaboration

- ⚡ Fun fact: "If it works, don't change it.."
